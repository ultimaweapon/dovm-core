Document Object View Model (DOVM) is a next generation framework for building a website by utilizing a full power of TypeScript.

## Problems of current frameworks

### React

- Virtual DOM.
- JSX is a mess.

### Angular

- Too big.
- Too complicated.
- No freedom for project structure.
- Slow.

### Vue

- Virtual DOM.
- No type safety in template.
- Limited type safety between component.

### Svelte

- TypeScript support is horrible.
- Reactivity rely on compiler.

### What is the problem with Virtual DOM?

Well, this blog from Svelte should explain the problems of Virtual DOM: https://svelte.dev/blog/virtual-dom-is-pure-overhead

If you are an experienced React or Vue developers I believed you already faced the problem by yourself.

## DOVM

After we developed Cloudsum√©, we decided to create our own framework due to all of available frameworks solve one problem but introduce another problem. Right now we currently experiment DOVM with our own company website: https://ultima.inc

### Design goal

- No Virtual DOM.
- Freedom on project structure.
- Simple and lightweight.
- HTML template instead of JSX, which is compile down into a render function.
- 100% type safety with TypeScript even in the template.
- Fully asynchronous everywhere.
- Direct access on DOM when you need it without any barrier.
- Automatic update only affected DOM when binding data updated using observer pattern.
- Direct access on child component.
- Easy on unit testing due to Dependency Injection.

### Runtime requirements

- ES2017

## Usage

### Install

```sh
npm i --save-dev @dovm/core
```

### webpack configurations

Refer to [dovm-loader](https://github.com/ultimicro/dovm-webpack) for how to configuring webpack.

### Type information for DOVM file

Before you can import DOVM file into TypeScript file you need to create `.d.ts` file with the following content in the root of repository:

```ts
// dovm.d.ts
declare module '*.dovm' {
  export function render(): Promise<void>;
}
```

### Settings for Visual Studio Code

Currently there are no extensions for VS Code to support DOVM. A simple workaround for syntax highlighting is to treat DOVM file as HTML file like this:

```json
{
  "files.associations": {
    "*.dovm": "html"
  }
}
```

### Application root

The following code will replace your `body`:

```ts
import { AppContainer, ComponentActivator, ServiceCollection } from '@dovm/core';
import App from './app';

bootstrap();

async function bootstrap() {
  const services = new ServiceCollection();

  services.add(ComponentActivator, () => new ComponentActivator());

  const app = new App({ services, container: new AppContainer() });
  await app.render();
}
```

```ts
// app.ts
import { Component } from '@dovm/core';
import { render } from './app.dovm';

export default class App extends Component {
}

App.prototype.render = render;
```

```html
<!-- app.dovm -->
<template>
  <body>Hello, world!</body>
</template>
```

### Router

Refer to [@dovm/router](https://github.com/ultimicro/dovm-router) for how to use.
